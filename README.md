# SAND-Analytics
--------

We're trying to detect the nodes in the network which cause packet loss. For that we're gonna start by analyzing the ps-trace data. 

In this pursuit of this we try to detect and collapse equal cost multi-paths. Impute/Remove the missing data and then train some ML models for prediction.
